What have I learnt from this tutorial? 

The use of callback functions in event listeners - as part of the arguments in event listeners - type of event (e.g. click or mouseover) and the 
callback function being invoked 

you can change more than one element at a time - by looping through the elements within the funciton 
e.g. fucntion.......{
let (i=0; i< elements.length; i++) {
    elements[i] (plus rest of code but the [i] means all elements will be chosen 
    the alternative is to index with one element e.g elements[1])
}
